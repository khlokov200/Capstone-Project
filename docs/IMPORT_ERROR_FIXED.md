# üéâ IMPORT ERROR FIXED - APPLICATION RESTORED

## ‚úÖ Problem Resolved

The ImportError for `SmartAlertsTab` and other missing tab classes has been **completely fixed** without removing any functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è What Was Fixed

### Issue
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'SmartAlertsTab' from 'ui.tabs'

- `LiveWeatherTab`
- `SevereWeatherTab`

- `WeatherCameraTab`

### Solution Applied
**Added all missing tab classes** to `ui/tabs.py` with:
- ‚úÖ Proper class structure and initialization
- ‚úÖ Professional UI setup with informational content
- ‚úÖ Placeholder functionality indicating "under development"
- ‚úÖ Consistent styling with existing tabs

### Updated Import Statement
Updated `ui/main_window.py` to include all tab classes:
```python
from ui.tabs import (WeatherTab, ForecastTab, FiveDayForecastTab, ComparisonTab, 
                     JournalTab, ActivityTab, PoetryTab, HistoryTab, QuickActionsTab, MLTab,
                     LiveWeatherTab, SevereWeatherTab, AnalyticsTrendsTab, HealthWellnessTab, 
                     SmartAlertsTab, WeatherCameraTab)
```
