# City Comparison Tab - JSON Implementation

## Overview

The City Comparison tab has been updated to use data from `team_cities.json` instead of making API calls. This document describes the changes made and how the new implementation works.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Source
- **Before**: City comparison data was fetched from weather API in real-time
- **Now**: Data is loaded from `data/team_cities.json` file

### 2. City List
- Available cities are now determined by the cities present in the JSON file
- The application falls back to default cities only if the JSON file can't be loaded

### 3. Weather Data Format
- Weather data is extracted from the `cities_analysis.city_data` section of the JSON
- Data fields mapped include:
  - Temperature (from `temperature.avg`)
  - Humidity (from `humidity.avg`)
  - Wind Speed (from `wind.avg`)
  - Weather Conditions (from `weather_conditions[0]`)

## Implementation Details

### File Loading
- The JSON file is loaded in the `_load_team_cities()` method
- City names are extracted from the JSON data structure
- The entire data structure is stored for later use in comparisons

### Data Processing
- When comparing cities, the application looks up data from the stored JSON instead of calling the API
- Only common metrics between cities are used for radar charts to avoid dimension mismatch
- Values are properly formatted for display in the UI

### Fallback Mechanism
- If the JSON file can't be loaded, the application falls back to default cities
- Error messages inform the user if data can't be found for a selected city

## Available Cities

The following cities are available in the team_cities.json file:
- New York
- Chicago
- Denver
- Providence
- Austin
- Rawlins
- Ontario
- Miami
- New Jersey

## Testing

To verify the JSON implementation works correctly:
1. Run the application using `python3 launch.py`
2. Navigate to the "City Comparison" tab
3. Select cities from the dropdown menus
4. Click "Compare" to see data loaded from the JSON file
5. Verify that charts display correctly using the JSON data

A test script (`test_comparison_json.py`) is also available to validate that the JSON file can be loaded correctly.
