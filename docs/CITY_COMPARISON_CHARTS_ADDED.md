# City Comparison Charts Implementation

## Overview

This update enhances the City Comparison tab with interactive charts and visualizations to better compare weather data between cities. The implementation adds a split-panel interface with text-based results on the left and visual charts on the right.

## Features Added

### 1. Enhanced UI Layout
- Split-panel interface using `ttk.PanedWindow`
- Left panel for city inputs and text results
- Right panel for charts and visualizations

### 2. Chart Generation Capabilities
- Temperature Comparison Chart: Bar chart showing temperature metrics for two cities
- Weather Metrics Radar Chart: Radar/spider chart comparing multiple metrics at once
- Humidity/Pressure Correlation Chart: Scatter plot with trend lines showing relationships
- Climate Trend Chart: Line chart displaying annual temperature trends with seasonal highlights

### 3. Interactive Chart Elements
- Tooltips and data labels for better readability
- Chart navigation toolbar (pan, zoom, save)
- Color-coded data for easy comparison

## Test Scripts
Several test scripts were created to validate the chart functionality:
- `test_comparison_quick.py` - Quick test of the complete UI
- `test_temperature_replacement.py` - Test for temperature comparison chart
- `radar_comparison_test.py` - Test for radar chart visualization
- `trend_comparison_test.py` - Test for climate trend comparison

## Usage
To access the charts:
1. Enter two city names in the left panel
2. Click any of the chart buttons in the right panel
3. Interact with the generated chart using the toolbar

## Sample Chart Outputs
The test scripts generate sample chart images:
- `temp_comparison_test.png`
- `radar_comparison_test.png`
- `trend_comparison_test.png`

## Technical Implementation
- Used matplotlib's `Figure` and `FigureCanvasTkAgg` for chart rendering
- Implemented chart generation methods in the `ComparisonTab` class
- Added chart area clearing functionality to prevent UI element overlap
- Enhanced test scripts for isolated feature testing
