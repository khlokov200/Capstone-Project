Breakout #1: Implementing Error-Resistant API Integration

Activity: In pairs, implement a robust weather data collector with comprehensive error handling.

Instructions:

1) Create a WeatherDataCollector class based on the provided template

2) Implement proper error handling for at least 3 different failure scenarios:
        Network connectivity issues
        Invalid API responses
        Rate limiting

3) Add data validation to ensure received data is reasonable

4) Test your implementation with both valid and invalid inputs

5) Document what errors you handled and how

Expected Output:

    A working WeatherDataCollector class with error handling
    Test cases demonstrating error recovery
    Documentation of error scenarios handled
    Validation logic for weather data

Discussion Points:
    What types of errors did you encounter during testing?
    How did your retry logic perform with simulated failures?
    What data validation checks did you implement?
    How would you extend this for multiple weather APIs?






Breakout #2: Building the Complete Data Collection System

Activity: In small groups, integrate all components into a working automated collection system.

Instructions:

1) Combine the WeatherDataCollector, WeatherDatabase, and orchestrator components

2) Set up automated collection for at least 3 different cities

3) Implement monitoring to track collection success/failure rates

4) Create a simple status dashboard that shows:
    Last collection time for each location
    Success rate over the last 24 hours
    Any recent errors

5) Test the system and ensure it handles errors gracefully

Expected Output:

    A fully integrated automated weather collection system
    Database with collected weather data from multiple locations
    Basic monitoring dashboard showing collection status
    Documentation of the system architecture

Discussion Points:
    How did you handle API rate limiting across multiple locations?
    What monitoring metrics are most important for this system?
    How would you scale this system to handle hundreds of locations?
