# Button Font Styling Enhancement Summary

## Overview
All buttons across the application have been updated to use dark, legible text colors to improve readability and user experience. This was achieved by using the "_black" suffix button styles that were already defined in the StyledButton class.

## Changes Made

### 1. Button Style Updates
- Updated all buttons in `ui/tabs.py` to use "_black" suffix styles (e.g., "primary_black", "info_black", etc.)
- Modified helper methods in `ui/tab_helpers.py` to automatically convert regular styles to black text styles
- Updated popup buttons and dialog buttons to use black text styles
- Updated button styling in `ui/main_window.py` for consistency

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Added documentation in `ui/components.py` explaining the style convention
- Added docstring to StyledButton class recommending black text styles
- Created a style guide for button styling consistency

### 3. Testing
- Created a test script `test_button_legibility.py` to visually verify all button styles

## Button Style Guide
- Use styles with "_black" suffix (e.g. "primary_black", "info_black") for all buttons to ensure dark text on light backgrounds
- Available styles with dark text:
  - primary_black: Light green background with black text
  - info_black: Light blue background with black text
  - accent_black: Gold background with black text
  - warning_black: Light orange background with black text
  - success_black: Pale green background with black text
  - cool_black: Sky blue background with black text

## Future Considerations
- Any new buttons added should use the "_black" suffix styles
- The helper methods in ButtonHelper will automatically append "_black" to style names if not already present
- If white text is specifically needed (e.g., for dark backgrounds), the regular style names can still be used

## Visual Verification
Run the test script to visually verify all button styles:
```
python test_button_legibility.py
```

This enhancement ensures that all buttons throughout the application have dark, legible text, improving the overall usability and accessibility of the Weather Dashboard Capstone Project.
