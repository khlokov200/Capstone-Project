# Capstone Milestone Submission - Weather Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
A comprehensive weather dashboard application built with Python/Tkinter that provides real-time weather data, forecasting, and advanced visualization features.

## ✅ Core Requirements Completed

### 1. Real-time Weather Data
- ✅ Current weather conditions for any city
- ✅ Live API integration with OpenWeatherMap
- ✅ Temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure display
- ✅ Weather descriptions and visibility data

### 2. Interactive Elements
- ✅ City search functionality across all tabs
- ✅ 5-day weather forecast with detailed daily breakdowns
- ✅ City comparison tool for multiple locations
- ✅ Weather history tracking and analysis
- ✅ Interactive weather journal with mood tracking
- ✅ Activity suggestion system based on weather conditions

### 3. Model Predictions in UI
- ✅ ML-powered temperature predictions
- ✅ Weather pattern analysis and anomaly detection
- ✅ Trend analysis for historical data
- ✅ Smart activity recommendations
- ✅ Poetry generation based on weather conditions

## 🚀 Feature 1: Advanced Chart Visualization System

### What It Is
A comprehensive data visualization system that generates interactive charts and graphs for weather data analysis across all application tabs.

### How It Works
- **Real-time Chart Generation**: Uses matplotlib integration to create dynamic charts
- **Multiple Chart Types**: Line charts, bar graphs, histograms, and pie charts
- **Split-screen Layout**: Each tab features a dedicated chart area alongside data controls
- **12 Different Chart Types** across 4 main tabs:
  
  **Forecast Tab (3 charts):**
  - Temperature trend line chart
  - Temperature & humidity bar chart
  - Temperature distribution histogram
  
  **5-Day Forecast Tab (3 charts):**
  - 5-day temperature trend with high/low lines
  - Multi-metric weather conditions bar chart
  - Rainfall probability chart with color coding
  
  **City Comparison Tab (3 charts):**
  - Temperature comparison between cities
  - Weekly temperature trend comparison
  - Global city temperature comparison
  
  **Weather History Tab (3 charts):**
  - Historical temperature trend analysis
  - Multi-period trend analysis with projections
  - Weather statistics distribution pie chart

### Technical Implementation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when matplotlib is unavailable
- **Professional Styling**: Color-coded charts with proper legends and labels
- **Interactive Windows**: Charts open in dedicated popup windows
- **Sample Data Integration**: Ready for real API data replacement

### Known Issues & Next Steps
- Currently uses sample data - needs integration with real API responses
- Chart export functionality could be enhanced
- Additional chart types (scatter plots, heatmaps) could be added

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Python Tkinter with custom styling
- **Backend**: Weather API integration, CSV data storage
- **ML Components**: Scikit-learn for predictions and analysis
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib with tkinter integration
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation
