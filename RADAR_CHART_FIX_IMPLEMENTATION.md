# Radar Chart Fix Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the city comparison functionality to automatically handle array shape mismatch issues when comparing cities with different available metrics, plus added a dedicated "Fix Comparison" button for manual fixes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Button Addition
- Added a new "ðŸ”§ Fix Comparison" button to the ComparisonTab UI
- Positioned the button in a new row for easy access

### 2. Fix Functionality
- Implemented the `fix_radar_comparison()` method in the ComparisonTab class
- The method finds common metrics between selected cities
- Uses only the common metrics to create a radar chart with matching dimensions
- Provides detailed feedback to the user about what was fixed

### 3. Enhanced Default Behavior
- Improved the `_create_radar_chart()` method to automatically detect and handle array shape mismatches
- Now automatically identifies common metrics between cities for all chart generation
- Added extended normalization support for a wider range of weather metrics
- Implemented adaptive error correction to reshape arrays when needed

### 4. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Added robust error handling for various scenarios
- Intelligently attempts to fix dimension mismatches automatically
- Falls back to manual fix option when automatic fix isn't possible
- Provides informative error messages when needed

## How It Works
### Automatic Fix (Now Default Behavior)
1. The system automatically detects when cities have different available metrics
2. It identifies all common metrics between the cities
3. Only the common metrics are used to create the radar chart
4. Arrays are automatically shaped and normalized to prevent dimension mismatches

### Manual Fix (Via Fix Button)
1. When complex issues occur or the user wants to regenerate the chart
2. User clicks the "Fix Comparison" button
3. The system performs a more thorough analysis of the cities' metrics
4. A detailed report shows the user which metrics were found and used

## Technical Implementation
- Uses set intersection to find common metrics between cities
- Applies normalized scaling for each metric type based on typical ranges
- Implements dynamic array reshaping to ensure dimension compatibility
- Enhanced error handling with multiple fallback options
- Extensive input validation and data type conversion

This enhancement makes the city comparison feature significantly more robust by handling differences in available metrics between cities, preventing the "Failed to compare cities: x and y must have same first dimension" error that previously caused crashes.
