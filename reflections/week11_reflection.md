# Week 11 Reflection: Project Setup & Foundation

## Summary
During Week 11, I established the foundation for my Weather Dashboard Capstone Project by setting up the basic architecture and core components. This week was focused on creating the initial project structure, implementing basic API connectivity, and establishing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

## Key Accomplishments

### Project Initialization
- Set up the basic project structure with clear separation of concerns
- Created the initial directory organization for controllers, services, models, and UI components
- Established the README.md file with project outline and goals
- Set up version control with Git

### Core Architecture Implementation
- Implemented the MVC architecture to ensure clean code separation
- Created the main.py entry point for the application
- Developed the initial version of WeatherController to manage application logic
- Set up basic error handling and logging mechanisms

### API Integration
- Researched and selected OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
- Implemented basic API integration with error handling
- Created a service layer to handle API communication
- Set up environment variables for API key management with dotenv

### UI Foundation
- Designed the initial UI wireframe with Tkinter
- Implemented the MainWindow class as the primary UI container
- Created the first functional tab (Current Weather)
- Set up basic styling and layout for the application

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Setting up a clean architecture that would scale as the project grew
  **Solution**: Researched best practices for Python application architecture and implemented MVC pattern

- **Challenge**: Managing API keys securely
  **Solution**: Implemented environment variable handling with dotenv to keep keys out of code

- **Challenge**: Creating a maintainable UI structure
  **Solution**: Designed a tab-based interface with component reusability in mind

## Lessons Learned
- The importance of planning architecture before diving into code
- How to properly structure a Python application for maintainability
- Best practices for API integration and error handling
- Setting up environment-based configuration for security

## Next Steps
- Expand the weather data retrieval to include forecasting
- Implement additional UI tabs for different weather features
- Add data validation and more robust error handling
- Begin implementing visualization capabilities with matplotlib

## Hours Invested
Approximately 20 hours spent on:
- Research and planning: 5 hours
- Architecture setup: 4 hours
- API integration: 5 hours
- UI development: 6 hours

## Code Metrics
- Lines of code written: ~600
- Files created: 12
- Basic functionality implemented: 25%
