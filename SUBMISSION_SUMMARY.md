# 📋 Capstone Milestone Submission Summary

## 🎯 Brief Description for Text Entry

My custom feature is an **Advanced Weather Visualization & Chart Generation System** that creates 12 different types of interactive matplotlib charts embedded directly within the tkinter GUI. The system includes professional line charts, bar graphs, histograms, and comparison visualizations across four main tabs (Forecast, 5-Day Forecast, City Comparison, and Weather History). Users can click dedicated "Generate Chart" buttons to create real-time visualizations of weather data, complete with trend lines, color coding, annotations, and professional styling. The charts open in new windows with full matplotlib functionality while maintaining seamless integration with the main application interface. Currently, the charts use well-structured sample data with clear placeholders for API integration; the next step is connecting them to live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for dynamic, real-time visualizations.
